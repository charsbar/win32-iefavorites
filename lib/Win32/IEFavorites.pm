=head1 NAME

Win32::IEFavorites - handles Internet Explorer's Favorites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::IEFavorites;

  my @items = Win32::IEFavorites->find('*del.icio.us');
  foreach my $item (@items) {
    print $item->url,"\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is to handle Internet Explorer's Favorites items
(Internet shortcuts). For now it only can grab shortcuts and
provide their properties (url, modified, iconfile, iconindex).
You may want to use this with some aggregator like Plagger.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 folder

Returns your IE's Favorites folder.

=head2 find ( some rules )

Returns your IE's Favorites as an array of ::Item objects.
Each object has url, modified, iconfile, iconindex properties.
Also accepts L<File::Find::Rule>'s matching rules for ->name().
The default rule is '*.url' (matches every favorite items).

=head1 CAVEATS FOR JAPANESE USERS

You *can* use shiftjis characters for matching rules as well,
though you might want to wrap it with quotemeta (or qr/\Q ... \E/)
to avoid the notorious 0x5c (\) problem.
